### Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I am Margaret Foster, a data scientist. I am good at developing techniques to measure hard-to-capture questions. I focus especially on interpretable strategies for analyzing text and event data. 
 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing the package for a bespoke Bayesian IRT Model that returns identifiable dimensions.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always looking for new, interesting, projects. Reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/margaretjfoster/) or email.
- âš¡ Fun fact: in a previous life, I was a qualitative threat hunter specializing in online extremist communities.

A guide to my previous work:

I have a long-running line of research on using machine learning and event data to estimate the behavior of threat actors. 
This is a tricky problem technically because data on internal processes is hard (or impossible!) to access. However, having estimates of change is important for improving risk evaluations because such actors decrease security and destabilize governance and trade.


I have given workshops on applying data science concepts to real-world data and problems. One such workshop, for the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping (UNDPO) [presented AI and NLP for peacekeeping data.](https://github.com/margaretfoster/slides/blob/main/AI%20and%20NLP%20for%20UN%20Data.pdf)

A deep dive of ML techniques used to profile the evolution of one such actor can be seen in [a 2022 presentation that I gave to the Sciences Po mÃ©dialab.](https://github.com/margaretfoster/slides/blob/dcd71a8907c1e3f4a5fc4d2675334c47610c151a/Foster_SPML_Nov2022.pdf).

In 2024 I presented on [using NLP to estimate threat actor changes from recorded behavior.](https://github.com/margaretfoster/slides/blob/main/Foster-TargetRWETalk_2024.pdf) The benefit of this technique is that it is interpretable and can be done at scale.
