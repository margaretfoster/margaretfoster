### Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I am Margaret Foster, a data scientist. I am good at finding interpretable ways to measure hard-to-capture questions.
 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing the package for a bespoke Bayesian IRT Model that returns identifiable dimensions.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always looking for new, interesting, projects.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: in a previous life, I was a qualitative threat hunter specializing in extremism.

A guide to my previous work:

I have a long-running line of research on using machine learning and event data to estimate the behavior of threat actors. 
This is a tricky problem technically because data on internal processes is hard (or impossible!) to access. However, having estimates of change is important for improving risk evaluations because such actors decrease security and destabilize governance and trade.

The most up-to-date status of that project can be viewed in [a 2022 presentation that I gave to the Sciences Po mÃ©dialab](https://github.com/margaretfoster/slides/blob/dcd71a8907c1e3f4a5fc4d2675334c47610c151a/Foster_SPML_Nov2022.pdf).

I have given workshops on applying data science concepts to real-world data and problems. One such workshop, for the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping (UNDPO) [presented AI and NLP for peacekeeping data](https://github.com/margaretfoster/slides/blob/main/AI%20and%20NLP%20for%20UN%20Data.pdf)
